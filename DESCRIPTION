Description: Calculates univariate Laplace and Wakefield Bayes factors for use
    in population-based genetic association studies. It can be used with
    genotype data or with haplotype data simulated from Hapgen2. If using
    Hapgen2 data files it assumes an additive genetic model. It can handle
    multiple datasets and can remove SNPs (from all datasets) falling below a
    MAF threshold in at least one dataset. Optionaly it will also return an LD
    matrix. It calculates true positive rates for use in ROC curves.
